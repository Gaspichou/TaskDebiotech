Dear Debiotech recruitment team,

Here is my code for the programming exercise that you gave me last week. 
Sorry for the delay, I tried to do it as soon as possible but the beginning of the week was pretty busy.
You can run the application by executing directly main.py or the file run.sh which will additionally check if Python is installed and download the required packages.
The duration of the execution is fixed to 20 seconds (to correspond to the expected output) but can be adjusted with the value of the limitTime variable in main.py. The loop can also be infinite by replacing the condition of the main loop to True.
The details of the implementation choices can be found in the comments of the code. 
I hope the way I solved the exercise will satisfy you and remain at your disposal if you need additional information or if there was a problem in the execution of the code.
I wish you a pleasant day,

Kind regards,

Gaspard Besacier
